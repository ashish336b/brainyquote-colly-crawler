The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it.

Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it.
